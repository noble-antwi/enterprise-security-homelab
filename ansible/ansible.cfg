# Configuration Notes:
# - remote_user changed from 'nantwi' to 'ansible' for service account
# - ask_sudo_pass changed from 'true' to 'false' for passwordless automation
# - roles_path explicitly set to 'roles' for modular architecture
# - Enhanced logging and performance optimizations for enterprise workflows
# - Supports both monolithic and role-based automation approaches

# Role Architecture Benefits:
# - Modular automation components for enterprise scalability
# - Reusable roles across multiple playbooks and projects
# - Clear separation of concerns (user management, updates, tools)
# - Professional automation practices used in production environments
# - Dual implementation strategy for educational and enterprise use

# SSH Key Management:
# The ansible-homelab-key provides passwordless authentication to all systems
# Key is configured for both personal (nantwi) and automation (ansible) accounts
# SSH config in ~/.ssh/config enables friendly hostnames for streamlined access

# Service Account Benefits:
# - Passwordless automation (no interruption for sudo passwords)
# - Clear audit trail separation (personal vs automated changes)
# - Enterprise-grade automation practices and security standards
# - Scalable foundation for complex automation workflows and role development

# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
