# Troubleshooting Guide

## üìñ Overview

This comprehensive troubleshooting guide documents common issues encountered during the enterprise homelab deployment, their root causes, solutions implemented, and preventive measures. The guide is organized by system component and includes both reactive solutions and proactive prevention strategies.

## üî• pfSense & Network Infrastructure Issues

### Issue 1: Lost Administrative Access After Interface Changes

#### **Problem Description**
After disabling the original LAN interface (`ue0`) on pfSense, complete administrative access was lost, preventing further configuration.

#### **Symptoms**
- pfSense Web GUI inaccessible from any network segment
- SSH access non-functional
- No method to access firewall configuration

#### **Root Cause**
Disabling the LAN interface removed the primary administrative access path without establishing an alternative access method.

#### **Solution Implemented**
```bash
# Emergency Recovery Method:
1. Physical console access to pfSense system
2. Reset interface configuration via console menu
3. Assign fallback IP address instead of disabling interface
4. Configure blocking rules instead of interface disabling
```

#### **Prevention Strategy**
‚úÖ **Always maintain administrative access** during network changes  
‚úÖ **Configure alternative access methods** before removing primary access  
‚úÖ **Use blocking rules** instead of disabling interfaces  
‚úÖ **Test changes in stages** rather than making multiple simultaneous changes  

#### **Current Implementation**
- LAN interface assigned `192.168.99.1` and isolated via firewall rules
- Management VLAN (VLAN 10) provides dedicated administrative access
- Multiple access paths available (console, SSH, Web GUI)

---

### Issue 2: Windows Client ICMP Connectivity Failures

#### **Problem Description**
Windows clients on various VLANs unable to ping network resources, including gateways and other systems.

#### **Symptoms**
- `ping` commands to local gateway failed
- `ping` to external addresses (8.8.8.8) successful
- Inconsistent connectivity behavior

#### **Root Cause**
pfSense firewall rules were blocking ICMP traffic by default, preventing ping functionality for network troubleshooting.

#### **Solution Implemented**
```
Firewall > Rules > [VLAN_NAME]:
- Added rule: Allow ICMP from VLAN subnet to Any
- Applied rules and verified functionality
- Tested from multiple VLAN segments
```

#### **Verification Process**
```bash
# Test connectivity from each VLAN
ping 192.168.10.1  # Management gateway - SUCCESS
ping 192.168.20.1  # BlueTeam gateway - SUCCESS  
ping 192.168.60.1  # Monitoring gateway - SUCCESS
ping 8.8.8.8       # External connectivity - SUCCESS
```

#### **Best Practices Established**
‚úÖ **Enable ICMP** for network troubleshooting on all VLANs  
‚úÖ **Test connectivity** from multiple network segments  
‚úÖ **Document firewall rules** for future reference  
‚úÖ **Implement systematic testing** after rule changes  

---

### Issue 3: Inter-VLAN Communication Challenges

#### **Problem Description**
Systems could reach external resources (internet) but failed to communicate with systems in other VLANs, impacting administrative access and monitoring.

#### **Symptoms**
- External connectivity functional (ping 8.8.8.8 successful)
- Inter-VLAN communication blocked
- Administrative access to monitoring systems failed

#### **Root Cause**
pfSense default-deny security model blocked all inter-VLAN communication unless explicitly permitted by firewall rules.

#### **Solution Process**
```
1. Identified required communication paths:
   - Management VLAN ‚Üí Monitoring VLAN (administrative access)
   - Management VLAN ‚Üí BlueTeam VLAN (SIEM management)
   - Monitoring VLAN ‚Üí All VLANs (metrics collection)

2. Created specific firewall rules:
   - Management VLAN: Allow to Monitoring VLAN subnet
   - Management VLAN: Allow to BlueTeam VLAN subnet  
   - Monitoring VLAN: Allow to Management VLAN subnet

3. Applied and tested rules systematically
```

#### **Validation Testing**
```bash
# From Management VLAN (192.168.10.2):
ssh nantwi@192.168.20.2  # Wazuh server - SUCCESS
ssh nantwi@192.168.60.2  # Monitoring server - SUCCESS

# From Monitoring VLAN (192.168.60.2):
ping 192.168.10.1        # Management gateway - SUCCESS
```

#### **Security Principles Maintained**
‚úÖ **Default-deny security model** preserved  
‚úÖ **Minimum required access** granted between VLANs  
‚úÖ **Explicit rule documentation** for all inter-VLAN communication  
‚úÖ **Regular access review** procedures established

## üñ•Ô∏è System Configuration Issues

### Issue 4: Netplan Gateway Deprecation Warnings

#### **Problem Description**
Ubuntu 24.04 systems generated deprecation warnings when using `gateway4` parameter in Netplan configuration.

#### **Symptoms**
```bash
sudo netplan apply
# Warning: `gateway4` has been deprecated, use default routes instead.
```

#### **Root Cause**
Netplan evolved to use modern routing syntax, deprecating the legacy `gateway4` parameter in favor of explicit route definitions.

#### **Legacy Configuration (Problematic)**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.10.2/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.10.1  # DEPRECATED
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]
```

#### **Modern Configuration (Solution)**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.10.2/24
      routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.10.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
```

#### **Implementation Process**
```bash
# 1. Update configuration file
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

# 2. Apply configuration
sudo netplan apply

# 3. Verify no warnings
# 4. Test connectivity
ping 192.168.10.1  # Gateway
ping 8.8.8.8       # Internet
```

#### **Best Practices Adopted**
‚úÖ **Use modern syntax** for all network configurations  
‚úÖ **Test configurations** in development before production  
‚úÖ **Document syntax changes** for team knowledge  
‚úÖ **Regular configuration reviews** to identify deprecated features  

---

### Issue 5: Netplan File Permission Warnings

#### **Problem Description**
Netplan configuration files generated security warnings about world-readable permissions.

#### **Symptoms**
```bash
sudo netplan apply
# Warning: netplan config files are world readable
```

#### **Security Risk**
Network configuration files containing potentially sensitive information (static IPs, DNS servers) accessible to all system users.

#### **Solution Implementation**
```bash
# Fix file permissions for all Netplan files
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/*.yaml

# Verify permissions
ls -la /etc/netplan/
# Expected: -rw------- (600 permissions)
```

#### **Security Benefits**
‚úÖ **Restricted file access** to root user only  
‚úÖ **Protected network configuration** from unauthorized viewing  
‚úÖ **Compliance with security best practices**  
‚úÖ **Eliminated warning messages** during configuration application  

---

## üîê SSH & Authentication Issues

### Issue 6: SSH Host Key Verification Failures

#### **Problem Description**
Ansible controller unable to connect to itself (`192.168.10.2`) due to host key verification failures.

#### **Symptoms**
```bash
ssh nantwi@192.168.10.2
# Host key verification failed
```

#### **Root Cause**
First SSH connection to the controller's own IP address requires host key acceptance, which wasn't performed during initial setup.

#### **Solution Process**
```bash
# Interactive SSH connection to accept host key
ssh nantwi@192.168.10.2
# Prompt: "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?"
# Response: yes
# Result: Host key added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

#### **Verification**
```bash
# Subsequent connections successful
ssh nantwi@192.168.10.2
# No host key prompts, direct connection established
```

#### **Prevention Strategy**
‚úÖ **Accept host keys** during initial system setup  
‚úÖ **Test SSH connectivity** as part of deployment verification  
‚úÖ **Document host key management** procedures  
‚úÖ **Automate host key acceptance** where appropriate  

---

### Issue 7: SSH Key Distribution Complexity

#### **Problem Description**
Manual SSH key distribution to multiple systems across different VLANs required careful coordination and verification.

#### **Challenge Areas**
- Multiple target systems with different IP addresses
- Cross-VLAN connectivity requirements  
- Verification of successful key installation
- Consistency across different operating systems

#### **Solution Framework**
```bash
# Systematic key distribution process:

# 1. Generate modern SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible-controller@lab-infrastructure"

# 2. Distribute to each system individually
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub nantwi@192.168.10.2  # Controller
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub nantwi@192.168.20.2  # Wazuh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub nantwi@192.168.60.2  # Monitoring

# 3. Verify passwordless access
ssh nantwi@192.168.10.2  # Test each connection
ssh nantwi@192.168.20.2
ssh nantwi@192.168.60.2

# 4. Test Ansible connectivity
ansible all_in_one -m ping
```

#### **Best Practices Developed**
‚úÖ **Use modern cryptography** (ED25519) for new key generation  
‚úÖ **Test each key distribution** immediately after installation  
‚úÖ **Maintain key distribution log** for auditing  
‚úÖ **Standardize user accounts** across all managed systems

## üåê Network Connectivity Issues

### Issue 8: VMware Network Bridge Configuration

#### **Problem Description**
Initial VMware network configuration resulted in VM isolation from the desired VLAN, preventing proper lab integration.

#### **Symptoms**
- VM receiving IP from wrong DHCP scope
- Unable to communicate with VLAN-specific resources
- Inconsistent network behavior

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
VMware was using default bridged networking instead of specific adapter bridging, causing the VM to connect to the wrong network segment.

#### **Solution Implementation**
```
VMware Workstation Pro Configuration:
1. Edit ‚Üí Virtual Network Editor
2. Create new bridged network: "Mgmt VLAN"
3. Bridge specifically to "Dell Gigabit Ethernet" adapter
4. Disable VMware DHCP for this network
5. Assign VM to "Mgmt VLAN" (VMnet4)
6. Restart VM networking
```

#### **Verification Process**
```bash
# Verify correct IP range assignment
ip addr show
# Expected: 192.168.10.x (Management VLAN range)

# Test VLAN-specific connectivity
ping 192.168.10.1  # Management gateway
```

#### **Network Architecture Benefits**
‚úÖ **Direct VLAN access** without host interference  
‚úÖ **Proper network segmentation** maintained  
‚úÖ **Native switch handling** of VLAN traffic  
‚úÖ **Consistent network behavior** across lab infrastructure
