# Windows Integration with Ansible

## Overview

This document details the successful integration of Windows hosts into the existing Ansible automation platform, enabling unified cross-platform management across Linux and Windows systems within the enterprise homelab infrastructure.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Achieved
- **Windows Host Integration**: Successfully added Windows 11 Pro host (192.168.10.3) to Ansible management
- **Cross-Platform Automation**: Unified control across 4 Linux systems + 1 Windows system = 5 total managed systems
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Professional Windows management via WinRM with dedicated service account
- **Network Integration**: Seamless integration within existing VLAN architecture and security controls
- **Automation Scaling**: Foundation for managing multiple Windows systems in enterprise environments

### Target Architecture
```
Ansible Controller (192.168.10.2)
├── Linux Infrastructure (SSH + ansible service account)
│   ├── 192.168.20.2 (Wazuh SIEM - Rocky Linux)
│   ├── 192.168.60.2 (Monitoring - Ubuntu)
│   ├── 192.168.10.4 (TCM Ubuntu)
│   └── 192.168.10.2 (Controller - Ubuntu)
└── Windows Infrastructure (WinRM + ansible user)
    └── 192.168.10.3 (Windows 11 Pro Host)
```

## Windows Host Preparation

### Step 1: PowerShell Execution Policy Configuration
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

**Purpose**: Enables PowerShell script execution required for Ansible automation

### Step 2: WinRM Service Configuration
```powershell
# Enable basic authentication
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'

# Allow unencrypted traffic for lab environment
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

# Configure client authentication
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/client '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

# Restart WinRM service
Restart-Service WinRM
```

**Verification Commands**:
```powershell
# Check WinRM configuration
winrm get winrm/config/service
winrm get winrm/config/client

# Verify service is listening
Get-Service WinRM
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener
```

### Step 3: Windows User Account Creation
Created dedicated automation user account:

**User Account Details**:
- **Username**: `ansible`
- **Password**: `AnsiblePass123!`
- **Group Membership**: Administrators
- **Properties**: Password never expires

**Creation Methods**:

**Method 1: Windows 11 Settings**
1. Press Win + I (Settings)
2. Click "Accounts" → "Other users"
3. Click "Add account"
4. Select "Add a user without a Microsoft account"
5. Configure user details and set as Administrator

**Method 2: PowerShell Command Line**
```powershell
# Create user account
net user ansible AnsiblePass123! /add

# Add to administrators group
net localgroup administrators ansible /add

# Set password to never expire
wmic useraccount where "Name='ansible'" set PasswordExpires=FALSE
```

### Step 4: Windows Firewall Configuration
```powershell
# Create firewall rule for WinRM
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WinRM HTTP In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5985 -Action Allow
```

**Critical Resolution**: This step was essential for resolving connection timeouts. Without this firewall rule, Ansible connections would fail despite WinRM being properly configured.

## Ansible Controller Configuration

### Prerequisites Installation
```bash
# Install Windows support on Ansible controller
sudo apt install python3-winrm

# Alternative pip installation (if system packages unavailable)
pip3 install pywinrm --break-system-packages
```

### Inventory Configuration

#### Group Variables Approach (Recommended)
Created clean configuration using group variables:

**File**: `/etc/ansible/group_vars/windows.yml`
```yaml
---
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_winrm_transport: basic
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
ansible_user: ansible
ansible_password: AnsiblePass123!
ansible_port: 5985
ansible_winrm_scheme: http
```

#### Updated Hosts File
**File**: `/etc/ansible/hosts`
```ini
# Existing Linux infrastructure
[all_in_one]
192.168.20.2   # Wazuh SIEM
192.168.60.2   # Grafana/Prometheus
192.168.10.4   # TCM Ubuntu
192.168.10.2   # Ansible Controller

# Windows systems
[windows]
192.168.10.3

# Combined cross-platform group
[all_systems:children]
all_in_one
windows
```

### Configuration Benefits
- **Clean Inventory**: Simple IP addresses without complex connection strings
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update credentials and settings centrally
- **Scalable**: Adding new Windows hosts requires only IP address addition
- **Professional**: Industry-standard approach for enterprise environments

## Testing and Validation

### Connectivity Testing
```bash
# Test Windows-specific connectivity
ansible windows -m win_ping
# Expected: SUCCESS => {"changed": false, "ping": "pong"}

# Test Linux systems (should continue working)
ansible all_in_one -m ping
# Expected: SUCCESS for all 4 Linux systems

# Cross-platform testing limitation
ansible all_systems -m ping
# Note: This fails for Windows as it uses Linux ping module
```

### Cross-Platform Automation Solution
Created dedicated playbook for mixed-platform environments:

**File**: `ansible/playbooks/ping_all_systems.yml`
```yaml
---
- name: Ping All Systems (Cross-Platform)
  hosts: all_systems
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
    # Linux systems
    - name: Ping Linux systems
      ping:
      when: ansible_os_family != "Windows"
      
    # Windows systems  
    - name: Ping Windows systems
      win_ping:
      when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"
```

**Execution**:
```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/ping_all_systems.yml
# Result: SUCCESS for all 5 systems (4 Linux + 1 Windows)
```

## Troubleshooting Resolution

### Key Issues Encountered and Resolved

#### Issue 1: Connection Timeout
**Problem**: HTTPConnectionPool timeout errors
**Root Cause**: Windows Firewall blocking WinRM port 5985
**Solution**: Created firewall rule allowing inbound TCP port 5985
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WinRM HTTP In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5985 -Action Allow
```

#### Issue 2: Authentication Configuration
**Problem**: WinRM service not accepting basic authentication
**Solution**: Configured both service and client for basic auth and unencrypted traffic
```powershell
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/client '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
```

#### Issue 3: Cross-Platform Module Conflicts
**Problem**: Windows systems failing with Linux ping module
**Solution**: Created conditional playbooks using `win_ping` for Windows and `ping` for Linux

#### Issue 4: PowerShell Execution Policy
**Problem**: PowerShell script execution failures
**Solution**: Set execution policy to RemoteSigned
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

## Operational Capabilities

### Current Management Scope
**Total Managed Systems**: 5 systems across 2 platforms
- **Linux Systems**: 4 (Ubuntu + Rocky Linux)
- **Windows Systems**: 1 (Windows 11 Pro)

### Cross-Platform Automation Examples

#### System Information Gathering
```bash
# Linux system information
ansible all_in_one -m shell -a "uname -a && uptime"

# Windows system information
ansible windows -m win_shell -a "Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object WindowsProductName,TotalPhysicalMemory"
```

#### Service Management
```bash
# Linux service management
ansible all_in_one -m systemd -a "name=ssh state=restarted"

# Windows service management
ansible windows -m win_service -a "name=WinRM state=restarted"
```

#### Software Management
```bash
# Linux package management
ansible ubuntu -m apt -a "name=curl state=present"
ansible rocky -m dnf -a "name=curl state=present"

# Windows software management (with Chocolatey)
ansible windows -m win_chocolatey -a "name=git state=present"
```

## Security Implementation

### Network Security
- **VLAN Integration**: Windows host properly placed in Management VLAN (192.168.10.0/24)
- **Firewall Controls**: pfSense manages inter-VLAN communication as with Linux systems
- **Port Security**: Only WinRM port 5985 opened for automation traffic
- **Access Control**: Windows automation restricted to Management VLAN sources

### Authentication Security
- **Dedicated User**: Separate `ansible` user account for automation purposes
- **Strong Password**: Complex password meeting Windows security requirements
- **Administrator Rights**: Necessary for system management tasks
- **Audit Trail**: Separate from personal user accounts for clear automation tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Windows Automation
- **Security Configuration**: Automated Windows security hardening
- **Software Deployment**: Standardized application installation across Windows systems
- **Configuration Management**: Windows registry and system configuration automation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Windows performance and security monitoring

### Scalability Considerations
- **Additional Windows Hosts**: Framework supports easy addition of new Windows systems
- **Role-Based Access**: Future implementation of granular Windows management roles
- **Certificate Authentication**: Migration from basic auth to certificate-based security
- **Active Directory Integration**: Enterprise identity management integration

## Windows Bootstrap Automation

### Automated User Creation Playbook
For future Windows systems, automation can be implemented:

**File**: `ansible/playbooks/bootstrap_windows.yml`
```yaml
---
- name: Bootstrap New Windows Machine for Ansible Management
  hosts: "{{ target_host }}"
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    ansible_user: "{{ initial_user }}"
    ansible_password: "{{ initial_password }}"
    ansible_connection: winrm
    ansible_winrm_transport: basic
    ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
    
  tasks:
    - name: Test initial connectivity
      win_ping:
      
    - name: Configure PowerShell execution policy
      win_shell: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
      
    - name: Create ansible service account
      win_user:
        name: ansible
        password: AnsiblePass123!
        groups:
          - Administrators
        password_never_expires: true
        state: present
        
    - name: Configure Windows Firewall for WinRM
      win_firewall_rule:
        name: WinRM HTTP In
        localport: 5985
        action: allow
        direction: in
        protocol: tcp
        
    - name: Test ansible user access
      win_ping:
      vars:
        ansible_user: ansible
        ansible_password: AnsiblePass123!
```

**Usage for New Windows Systems**:
```bash
# Bootstrap new Windows machine
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/bootstrap_windows.yml \
    -e "target_host=192.168.10.5" \
    -e "initial_user=YourWindowsUser" \
    -e "initial_password=YourWindowsPassword"
```
