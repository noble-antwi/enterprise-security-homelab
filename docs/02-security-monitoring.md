# Security Monitoring & Wazuh SIEM Deployment

## üìñ Overview

This document details the deployment and configuration of **Wazuh SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** as the cornerstone of the Blue Team security monitoring infrastructure. The implementation establishes comprehensive security monitoring capabilities using an all-in-one Wazuh deployment on **Rocky Linux 9.6**, strategically positioned within the dedicated **BlueTeam VLAN**.

## üéØ Deployment Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Deploy latest **Wazuh SIEM (version 4.12.0)** for comprehensive security monitoring
- Establish centralized log collection and analysis capabilities
- Create foundation for threat detection and incident response
- Implement security monitoring without impacting other network segments

### Strategic Placement
- **VLAN Assignment**: BlueTeam VLAN (VLAN 20 - `192.168.20.0/24`)
- **Network Isolation**: Separated from other lab functions
- **Security Focus**: Dedicated environment for defensive security operations

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Preparation & Network Configuration

### Hardware Specifications
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Hostname** | `lab-core-rocky` |
| **Operating System** | Rocky Linux 9.6 (Blue Onyx) |
| **Architecture** | x86_64 |
| **Network Interface** | `enp0s20f0u4` |
| **Switch Connection** | Port 4 (Untagged VLAN 20) |

### Network Configuration Process

#### Initial Interface State Assessment
After connecting the server to **Port 4** and booting Rocky Linux:

**Interface Status Check:**
```bash
ip a
```

**Observed State:**
- Interface `enp2s0`: **DOWN** (unused)
- Interface `enp0s20f0u4`: **UP** (active, no IP assigned)

#### Network Setup Evidence

### DHCP Verification & Testing

Before implementing static IP configuration, DHCP connectivity was verified to confirm proper VLAN assignment and network functionality.

#### DHCP Configuration Commands
```bash
# Create new network connection with DHCP
sudo nmcli con add type ethernet ifname enp0s20f0u4 con-name BlueTeam-DHCP ipv4.method auto

# Activate the connection
sudo nmcli con up BlueTeam-DHCP
```

#### DHCP Test Results
‚úÖ **Dynamic IP Assignment**: `192.168.20.50/24` (within expected DHCP range)  
‚úÖ **Gateway Connectivity**: Successfully pinged `192.168.20.1`  
‚úÖ **VLAN Verification**: Confirmed placement in BlueTeam VLAN  

### Static IP Implementation

For production SIEM deployment, a **predictable static IP address** was required to ensure consistent access and monitoring capabilities.

#### Target Static Configuration
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **IP Address** | `192.168.20.2/24` |
| **Gateway** | `192.168.20.1` |
| **DNS Servers** | `8.8.8.8` |
| **Connection Name** | `BlueTeam-Static` |

#### Static Configuration Commands
```bash
# Modify existing connection to static configuration
sudo nmcli con mod BlueTeam-DHCP \
  ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses 192.168.20.2/24 \
  ipv4.gateway 192.168.20.1 \
  ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8

# Restart connection to apply changes
sudo nmcli con down BlueTeam-DHCP
sudo nmcli con up BlueTeam-DHCP

# Rename connection for clarity
sudo nmcli con mod BlueTeam-DHCP connection.id BlueTeam-Static
```

#### Configuration Verification

#### Connectivity Validation
```bash
# Verify static IP assignment
ip a

# Test gateway connectivity
ping -c 4 192.168.20.1

# Verify internet connectivity
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

**Results**: ‚úÖ All connectivity tests successful - static configuration operational

## üì¶ Wazuh SIEM Deployment Process

### Pre-Installation System Preparation

#### System Updates & Dependencies
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo dnf update -y

# Install required utilities
sudo dnf install -y curl wget unzip gnupg2
```

#### Clean Previous Installations
Since Wazuh had been previously attempted on this system, comprehensive cleanup was performed to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Remove any existing Wazuh packages
sudo dnf remove -y wazuh-* filebeat opensearch-dashboard

# Clean configuration and data directories
sudo rm -rf /etc/wazuh-* /var/lib/wazuh-* /usr/share/wazuh-* /etc/filebeat /var/lib/filebeat
```

### Wazuh Installation Implementation

#### Installer Acquisition
```bash
# Download official Wazuh all-in-one installer
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh

# Make installer executable
chmod +x wazuh-install.sh
```

#### All-in-One Deployment
The Wazuh team's recommended deployment method was used for comprehensive SIEM functionality:

```bash
# Execute all-in-one installation
sudo ./wazuh-install.sh -a -i -o
```

**Installation Parameters:**
- `-a` : Install all components (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard, Filebeat)
- `-i` : Ignore OS compatibility check (Rocky Linux support)
