echo "[IP_ADDRESS]   # [DESCRIPTION] - $(date)" >> /etc/ansible/hosts
ansible [IP_ADDRESS] -m ping
```

#### Windows Systems
```bash
# Run automated bootstrap process
ansible-playbook bootstrap_windows.yml \
    -e "target_host=[IP_ADDRESS]" \
    -e "initial_user=Administrator" \
    -e "initial_password=[ADMIN_PASSWORD]" \
    -e "ansible_service_password=Password123"
```
